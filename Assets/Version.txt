Description:
	Red frenzy is a new move performed with the ";" key or "Right trigger", this move acts similar to a 5H, but it also makes you teleport in-front of the opponent and causes knockdown (Requires white health).
	Every time damage is dealt to a small portion of it is turned to white health, you can use it to do Red Frenzy(RF) or gain it back by doing a Blue Frenzy(BF).
	5H now has super armor meaning that you can take damage but not get stunned when performing it, you can conter 5H with another 5H or RF, or parry it with a BF.
	Physics and animations are now deterministic, this will make the movement feel a bit different and is a big step for Rollback Netcode in the future.
	With the addition of the deterministic features, the replay system is now consistent and should behave correctly.
	The command list has now a better User Experience, and provides more information for common moves and normal moves.
	Hitstop is now more consistent.
	This change is done to discourage spamming on neutral.
	Training mode info now also displays the combo damage, and the UI is centered to be more visually clear.
	The new song can be accessed in the character select.
	Now the camera centers when the round is over, there is also new VFX for hitting and wallsplat.
	Fixed an issue where the sprite would flicker between the two players, also fixed the players not flipping correctly at times & more.
