Description:
	Nocturne is a fast and agile character.
	To escape a throw, press the throw button in a small window to escape from it.
	To jump cancel simply press to jump once you land a hit, you can jump cancel only after 2H on ground, or any attack middair, but the attack has to hurt the opponent(This mechanic will be useful for combos when juggling is implemented).
	Once your health reaches 30% you will enter Demon Limit and you will gain a 20% permanent damage buff, demon limit (DM) is signified by a red border on the health bar.
	In the command list there is a new prompt that allows you to toggle between the video showcase and framedata information about the move.
	The character select screen UI and loading screen UI has improved. The health bar has also changed to help indicate the 30% health point for demon limit.
	Minor stability fixes to keep the replay system more consistent with results(Still needs more fixes).
	Improved hitstop with arcana moves and other minor changes on various moves to make them feel better.
	Fixed some issues with PS4 controllers and other minor bug fixes.
