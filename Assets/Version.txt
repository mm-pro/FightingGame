Description:
	The Grid stage is now in 3D perspective, if this works well expect the other stages to follow.
	The camera will now zoom in and out depending on the players distance.
	Added back the in-game notifications of certain actions (Knockback, Tech throw, Reversal etc).
	If a match takes too long to establish you will automatically leave the match so that you won't be stuck waiting.
	You can view an input display to get a better idea of what you are pressing.
	Added new Shadow "D", a quick horizontal projectile, strong for combos and neutral but lacks damage and has longer charge time.
	Blockstun now recovers faster than hitstun, making more moves minus on block
	Walk backwards and walk forward have now different speeds, with walk backwards being slower.	
	Back air dash and forward air dash have now different speeds, with back air dash being slower.
	Improve the overall feel of air dash, also having an arc at the end of it.
	Backdash is now throw invulnerable.
	Every jump now has a few frames of pre-jump in which the player cannot block.
	You can now only chain to a 5H from a light attack, making guard breaks a bit easier to predict.
	Shadow Meter no longer increases while you area doing a combo.
