Description:
	This is an initial version of a parry(Called Blue Frenzy, this naming will make more sense in a later patch), during a succesful Blue Frenzy you gain half an arcana bar, useful against  projectiles or on unsafe moves.
	You can now choose which direction to throw the opponent by holding the direction when throwing, useful for regaining corner advantage.
	The command list menu shows all the arcana moves each character has and explains their properties.
	The damage scaling is very simple currently, every consecutive hit will get the damage decreased by 0.97%.
	There's currently two combo timers, the yellow one is the normal one which happens when you get a hit, the red one occurs only with heavy attacks and has a smaller combo window.
	Changed bridge stage art to match the temple stage art, will probably continue to do this with the other stages. Art made by Melusaaste
	Minor repositions of UI and minor visual changes for input history.
	Minor bug fix for when selecting player controllers, and fixed a bug that would cause the opponent to drop slowly when hitting them in the air during their arcana move.
